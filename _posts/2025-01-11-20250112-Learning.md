# Some life changes
Away from 4 months, I'm back to learning. I found a new job and settled down everythingðŸ˜Š. Everything is on track. In this 4 months, I wrote a lot leetcode problems and reviewed a lot of knowledge and got interviewed by many companies.

In this new year, I still used Tim Ferriss's "past year review" to review my past year. This helped me to find out what things I really want to do and don't want to do. [Forget New Year's Resolutions and Conduct a 'Past Year Review' Instead (#559) - The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/)

Following is template of past year review.

âœ… What were the significant moments, memories, and milestones this year? Try to choose 3â€“5 for each month.
âœ… How can I become a better version of myself in these roles:
    â€¢ Son/Daughter
    â€¢ Employee
    â€¢ Manager
    â€¢ Partner
    â€¢ Mentor
    â€¢ Friend?
âœ… What has weighed on my mind throughout the year? What have I learned from it? What things, when I reflect on them, feel unpleasant, drain my energy, and have lingered all year?
    â€¢ People
    â€¢ Places
    â€¢ Habits
    â€¢ Tasks
â€¢ Experiences
âœ… How can I do less of these next year?
âœ… How have I grown as a person?
    â€¢ New habits
    â€¢ New priorities
    â€¢ New preferences
    â€¢ New perspectives
âœ… Break your life into categories and dive deep into each one:
    â€¢ Health
    â€¢ Wealth
    â€¢ Relationships
    â€¢ Experiences
    â€¢ Operations
    â€¢ Side projects
    â€¢ Career
âœ… What are the things that, when I look back, brought me the most energy and joy?
    â€¢ People
    â€¢ Places
    â€¢ Habits
    â€¢ Tasks
    â€¢ Experiences
âœ… How can I do more of these next year?
âœ… What am I most grateful for this year? Maintain this list throughout the year and review it at the end.
âœ… Whatâ€™s on my "Best List"?
    â€¢ Books
    â€¢ Events
    â€¢ Articles
    â€¢ Podcasts
    â€¢ Purchases
    â€¢ New habits
âœ… Where do I feel I am lacking the most?
âœ… What is the biggest bottleneck to my ongoing growth? Why havenâ€™t I stayed focused on removing it?
âœ… Imagine your career as a game, and ask:
    â€¢ What game am I playing?
    â€¢ What are the rules of the game?
    â€¢ How do players advance?
    â€¢ How do players fail?
    â€¢ Is this game still serving me?
âœ… Are there things I could start doing today that would guarantee a terrible year? How can I avoid doing these things?
âœ… Where am I being overly serious? Where am I making things harder than they need to be? With my limited resources:
    â€¢ Time
    â€¢ Energy
    â€¢ Attention
    â€¢ Capital
âœ… Am I "spending" or "investing" them? Where am I mostly wasting them?
âœ… How am I complicit in creating the conditions I say I donâ€™t want?
âœ… If I had unlimited money, how would I invest it today to increase my time, energy, or happiness?
âœ… If I repeated my weekly actions over five years, where would I end up? Is that the result I want?
âœ… How can I achieve my 10-year goals in one year? Likewise, how can I accomplish 10 times my one-year goals this year?
